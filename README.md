# Compass ⭐
Compass is an iOS/Android app designed to point people to the California State resources they need. Compass communicates with [Compass Analytics](https://www.github.com/kornershop/Compass-Analytics), by way of socket.io, to anonymously track data to help better inform those whose mission it is to provide these resources.

## What problem are we solving?
According to the U.S Census Bureau, 38,398,077 (about 16%) Californian residents live in poverty. Of that 16%, 20% of those individuals speak Spanish. The Public Policy Institute of California indicates that some of the most important safety nets for these families are CalFresh (SNAP/Food Stamps) and WIC (Women Infant and Children). Contrary to popular belief and political rhetoric, these resources are vastly underutilized. 1,111,897 individuals benefited from WIC resources as of by 2016. Moreover, 21,311,383 individuals are currently enrolled in SNAP. But, this means about 15 million individuals who are eligible for assistance aren’t receiving any. Maybe they don’t know they are eligible or maybe they don’t know where to look? Maybe the process itself feels too overwhelming and spread out. 

## Our inspiration?
Code for America's Get CalFresh project has allowed thousands of CA residents to determine eligibility for SNAP resources. After discovering this, we wanted to not only link user's to this preexisting resource but provide a similar experience for those in need of WIC resources, as well as help them find offices near them.

## Why a mobile app? 
According to the PEW research institute, about 13% of low-income Americans rely on their phone as their sole internet access point. Of that percentage, 13% speak Spanish. This is why Compass is mobile first and bilingual. We streamline information to our users in a friendly, intuitive and resourceful manner.

## User flow 🌊
* Choose your language (English or Spanish).
* Determine eligibility for CalFresh and/or WIC resources.
* CalFresh eligibility is determined by Code for America's [Get CalFresh](https://www.getcalfresh.org/).
* WIC eligibility is determined by filling out a short form.
* If you're likely eligible for WIC, you'll be given a short list of next steps (necessary phone numbers included).
* If you're likely ineligble for WIC, we'll display a map full of food banks near you (phone numbers & addresses included).
* Once you've determined likelihood of eligibilty for either resource, head over to the map tab and locate offices near you (user's must apply in person for both CalFresh and WIC).
* WIC specific: Once you've applied in person and have been approved, you can use Compass's map to locate WIC friendly grocery stores near you (all grocery stores accept CalFresh in the state of CA)!
