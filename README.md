# Compass-Native ⭐
Compass is an iOS/Android app designed to point people to the California State resources they need.

## What problem are we solving?
According to the U.S Census Bureau, 38,398,077 (about 16%) Californian residents live in poverty. Of that 16%, 20% of those individuals speak Spanish. The Public Policy Institute of California indicates that some of the most important safety nets for these families are CalFresh (SNAP/Food Stamps) and WIC (Women Infant and Children). Contrary to popular belief and political rhetoric, these resources are vastly underutilized. 1,111,897 individuals benefited from WIC resources as of by 2016. Moreover, 21,311,383 individuals are currently enrolled in SNAP. But, this means about 15 million individuals who are eligible for assistance aren’t receiving any. Maybe they don’t know they are eligible or maybe they don’t know where to look? Maybe the process itself feels too overwhelming and spread out.

## How does Compass help do this?
According to the PEW research institute, about 13% of low-income Americans rely on their phone as their sole internet access point. Of that percentage, 13% speak Spanish. This is why Compass is mobile first and bilingual.  We streamline information to our users in a friendly, intuitive and resourceful manner. Whether they want to find a Welfare office near them, see if they are eligible for WIC, or apply for food stamps online they just need Compass to start their journey.

## Inspiration
Code for America's Get CalFresh project has allowed thousands of CA residents to determine eligibility for SNAP resources. After discovering this, we wanted to not only link user's to this preexisting resource but provide a similar experience for those in need of WIC resources, as well as help them find offices near them.
